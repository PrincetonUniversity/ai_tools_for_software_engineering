# Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) can be trained on a vast number of high-quality code repositories. These models can then be used for a variety of software engineering tasks including code generation.

The figure below shows an overview of the process:

(figure here)

In the figure above, the model is trained on a large amount high-quality code that has been written by hand. The trained model can then be used to solve software engineering problems. For instance, it can be prompted to generate a custom function in the Python programming language.

## Pros and Cons of A.I. versus conventional coding

When should a researcher try to use one of the A.I. tools as opposed to convential methods?

When should a researcher expect to write their own code?

What are the limitations of LLMs for software engineering?

What does the future look like?
