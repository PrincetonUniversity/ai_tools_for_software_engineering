# Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) can be trained on a vast number of high-quality code repositories. These models can then be used for a variety of software engineering tasks including code generation.

The figure below shows an overview of the process:

In the figure above, the model is trained on a large amount high-quality code that has been written by hand. The trained model can then be used to solve software engineering problems. For instance, it can be prompted to generate a custom function in the Python programming language.

A.I. tools can be used for:

- code generation  
- language translation
- debugging assistance
- code navigation  
- writing test code  
- generating documentation  
- parallelizing code
- IDE integration with code completion

## Important Points

- The A.I. tools are not perfect. Think of their output as a starting point that you will validate and modify as opposed to an immediate final solution.
- In order to evaluate the output of an A.I. model you must know the language and domain.
- If you choose to use the A.I. tools then you are responsible for whatever output they generate. That is, if the code contained a bug then it is your fault for using the code.

## Responsibility

For licensing issues regarding the use of A.I. generated code, see [LLMs and code assistants on INTERSECT](https://intersect-training.org/software-licensing/07-collaboration/index.html).
