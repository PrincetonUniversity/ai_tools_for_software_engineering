# A.I. Tools for Software Engineering

This guide provides an overview of A.I. tools that can be used toward various aspects of software engineering. The target audience is academic researchers. The focus is code generation with Microsoft Copilot, which is available to everyone at Princeton. We also discuss how A.I. can be used for testing, porting code, automatically fixing bugs, parallelizing code and more.
