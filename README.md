# A.I. Tools for Software Engineering

This guide provides an overview of A.I. tools that can be used toward various aspects of software engineering. The target audience is academic researchers. We discuss various tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Le Chat, but it is worth noting that Microsoft Copilot is already available to everyone at Princeton for free and GitHub Copilot can be requested. We also discuss how A.I. can be used for testing, porting code, automatically fixing bugs, parallelizing code and more.

## Resources and Learning Materials

### Chatbots

[Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) - A GenAI chatbot designed for computer code by Microsoft  
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - A popular tool that integrates with GitHub and VSCode  
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - A popular GenAI chatbot by OpenAI  
[Claude](https://claude.ai/) - Anthropic's chatbot which many credit as best at coding  
[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) - Google's chatbot which has many nice integrations if you're already in that ecosystem  
[Le Chat](https://chat.mistral.ai/) - from Mistral, a startup in France  

### Tools and Benchmarks
