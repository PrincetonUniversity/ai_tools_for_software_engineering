# Microsoft Copilot

On May 20, 2024, OIT announced:

> Microsoft Copilot (formerly known as Bing Chat), a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can be used to generate or analyze text and images, is now available for use at Princeton University. Copilot is currently the only generative AI tool made available by the Office of Information Technology (OIT).
>
> Data security, privacy and accuracy in Copilot 
>
> In order to help secure Princeton data and reduce risk to the University, it is recommended that you avoid writing prompts that include restricted or confidential information, including proprietary research data. 
>
> Additionally, AI responses can be biased, inaccurate, or may contain copyrighted information. Always review, validate, and iterate on responses provided before sharing them more broadly. 
>
> How to use Copilot with your Princeton netID 
>
> To use Copilot, sign in with a work or school account using a princeton.edu netID and password. Doing so will provide greater data protection, in which data is not saved or used to train the model. The same level of protection is not available when using Copilot without your Princeton.edu account or another generative AI tool.
