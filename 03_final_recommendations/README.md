# Final Recommendations

## Should Princeton researchers that write code learn the A.I. tools?

Yes. There are several software engineering tasks where the A.I. tools will save you time and improve the overall quality of your project. This statement accounts for the time it takes for one to learn the tools. Additionally, the practice of using A.I. for software engineering will only become more fundamental in the coming years.

## Final Takeaways

- The current A.I. tools are useful but not perfect. Think of their output as a starting point that you will validate and modify. Do not think of A.I. generated code as an immediate final solution.
- In order to evaluate the output of an A.I. model you must know the programming language and maybe research domain. For example, if you do not know Python then do not use A.I. generated Python code since you will not be able to validate it.
- If you choose to use A.I. generated code then you are responsible for that code. That is, if the code contained a bug then you take responsibility for the bug.
