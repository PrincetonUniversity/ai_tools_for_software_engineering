# Final Recommendations

## Should researchers at Princeton that write code learn the A.I. tools?

Yes. There are several software engineering tasks where the A.I. will save you time and improve overall code quality. This accounts for the time it takes for one to learn the tools. Additionally, the practice of relying on A.I. for software engineering will only become more fundamental in the coming years.
