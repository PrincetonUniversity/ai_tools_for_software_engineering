# Final Recommendations

## Should Princeton researchers that write code learn the A.I. tools?

Yes. There are several software engineering tasks where the A.I. tools will save you time and improve overall quality of your project. This statement accounts for the time it takes for one to learn the tools. Additionally, the practice of using A.I. for software engineering will only become more fundamental in the coming years.

## Which tasks do the existing A.I. tools work well for?

## Which tasks do the existing A.I. tools NOT work well for?

# Final Takeaway

You should use an LLM. If you use code generated by an LMM then you are responsible for the code. That means you should understand what it is and take responsiblity for it if it is wrong.
