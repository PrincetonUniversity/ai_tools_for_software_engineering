# Final Recommendations

## Should Princeton researchers that write some code learn the A.I. tools?

Yes. There are several software engineering tasks where the A.I. tools will save you time and improve overall quality of your project. This statement accounts for the time it takes for one to learn the tools. Additionally, the practice of using A.I. for software engineering will only become more fundamental in the coming years.
